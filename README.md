# reckless-bank
A minimal full-stack banking application.

## Prerequisites
- Java 21
- Gradle
- npm

## Running the Application
After cloning the repository, run the script:

```bash
    ./run-bank.sh

This will start both the backend and frontend servers, as well as opening the application in your default web browser. If the script does not have execute permissions, you may need to run:

```bash
    chmod +x run-bank.sh
```
